# natours-flexbox

Web page project from CSS course on Udemy, used for learning purposes.
The page was built by me while taking the online course.
The design of this page was created by Jonas Schmedtmann, an author of the online course "Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!".

## Implemented improvements

- The original version of this page was built using floats. I've replaced the floats approach with the Flexbox.
- Some JS code was added to close navigation and popup.
- Smooth scrolling was implemented.

## Test it live!
